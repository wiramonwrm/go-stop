The project is live on: https://wiramonwrm.github.io/go-stop/

The project is a simple HTML page that takes users’ voices as an input to manipulate the movement of the content shown.

There are two texts running from right to left and left to right on the screen.
The program will initiate and start recognizing audio input.
- If the user says ‘stop’, both texts will stop moving.
- If the user says ‘go’, both texts will continue the movement.

The model is trained using Google Teachable Machine.
